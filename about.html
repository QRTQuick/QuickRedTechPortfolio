    <section id="company-overview">
      <h2>Company Overview</h2>
      <p>Quick Red Tech is a purpose-driven software innovation studio founded on <strong>August 12, 2024</strong>. We focus on building developer-first products and intelligent automation that speed up workflows, improve reliability, and let teams ship with confidence.</p>
      <p>Our products and services span system utilities, developer automation, web and app platforms, and open-source tools. We balance pragmatic engineering with thoughtful design: shipping lean, well-tested solutions that scale across individual developers, small teams and enterprise tooling needs.</p>
      <p>Core commitments: <strong>privacy by design</strong>, meaningful open-source contributions, and developer ergonomics — tools that feel native to the workflow rather than obstruct it.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ceo">
      <h2>About the CEO</h2>
      <p><strong>Chisom Life Eke</strong> — Founder &amp; CEO. <span id="ceo-age">Age: 16 (Nigerian)</span></p>
      <p>Chisom is a self-driven engineer and product builder who combines systems-level engineering with intuitive product design. Since founding Quick Red Tech, Chisom has led the creation of projects like <em>StackCheckMate</em>, <em>D-Red-Bot</em> and <em>Shinpuru-Sachi</em>, focusing on tools that remove friction for developers.</p>
      <p>Areas of expertise: systems programming, developer tooling, cross-platform utilities and AI-assisted workflows. Chisom's leadership emphasizes fast iteration, clear technical documentation, and building for long-term maintainability.</p>

    <section id="team">
      <h2>The Team</h2>
      <p>Quick Red Tech operates with a compact, multidisciplinary core team of engineers, designers and operations specialists. We favour deep ownership, rapid learning loops and a pragmatic approach to solving real developer problems.</p>
      <p>Roles and strengths within the team include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Core Engineering:</strong> systems, backend services, native tooling and performance optimization.</li>
        <li><strong>Product & Design:</strong> UX-first interfaces for developer tools, accessibility, and clear onboarding.</li>
        <li><strong>DevOps & Infra:</strong> CI/CD, packaging, releases and reproducible environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Community & Documentation:</strong> clear docs, examples and open-source stewardship.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We are remote-first with collaborators across time zones. If you're interested in joining or contributing, reach out via the <a href="index.html#contact">Contact</a> section — we look for curiosity, craftsmanship, and a bias for action.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="aim">
      <h2>Aim</h2>
      <p>Our immediate aim is to reduce developer friction across common workflows: environment setup, dependency management, testing, packaging and deployment. We build lean tools that automate repetitive tasks while exposing safe, auditable controls for developers and teams.</p>
      <p>We prioritize shipping small, high-value features fast — features that replace tedious manual steps, shorten feedback loops, and improve developer confidence. Each release focuses on measurable improvements like build time reductions, fewer integration failures, or clearer debugging information.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="vision">
      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>We envision a future where routine developer work is reliably automated by tools that are predictable, transparent, and respectful of developer intent. In that world, more engineers focus on creative problem solving rather than repetitive maintenance.</p>
      <p>Our long-term vision includes a suite of interoperable utilities that adapt to team workflows, integrate with existing toolchains, and facilitate collaboration across roles — from individual contributors to large engineering organizations.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mission">
      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>Quick Red Tech's mission is to deliver practical, privacy-first developer tools and automation systems that scale. We combine careful engineering with human-centered product design to ensure our solutions are helpful, reliable and maintainable.</p>
      <p>We commit to open documentation, reproducible builds, and community-driven improvements. Our goal is not to replace developers but to amplify their impact by removing friction, improving observability, and making complex operations safe and repeatable.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="values">
      <h2>Values</h2>
      <p>Our working values guide every decision at Quick Red Tech:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pragmatism:</strong> Ship solutions that solve real problems — not hypothetical ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Respect for Developers:</strong> Design tools that give control and explain their actions clearly.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy & Security:</strong> Minimize data collection and default to local-first processing where appropriate.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Collaboration:</strong> Share learnings, document well, and invite contributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Prefer minimal, composable features over complex, monolithic tooling.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="milestones">
      <h2>Milestones</h2>
      <p>Key milestones since founding:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Aug 12, 2024</strong> — Quick Red Tech founded.</li>
        <li><strong>Oct 2024</strong> — Initial release of <em>StackCheckMate</em> (environment automation prototype).</li>
        <li><strong>Dec 2024</strong> — Early D-Red-Bot tooling, Windows system utility proof-of-concept.</li>
        <li><strong>Mar 2025</strong> — Open-source release of small developer utilities and improved documentation site.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We track progress through outcomes: user adoption of tools, reduced setup times, and direct feedback from developers who save time using our software.</p>

    <section id="how-we-work">
      <h2>How We Work</h2>
      <p>We follow a lean, iterative process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Identify:</strong> Talk with real users to validate pain points.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototype:</strong> Build minimal proofs-of-concept and gather quick feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>Ship:</strong> Release small, testable features with clear rollback plans.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure:</strong> Use telemetry (with consent) and user feedback to iterate.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We prefer short cycles, strong tests, and clear migration paths so teams can adopt our tools gradually without risk.</p>
