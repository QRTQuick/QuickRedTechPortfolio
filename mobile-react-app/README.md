# Quick Red Tech — Mobile React App

This is a small Vite + React scaffold for a mobile-first version of the Quick Red Tech site.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\DELL\OneDrive\Desktop\Quick Red Tech portfolio\mobile-react-app"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

What this includes:
- Minimal mobile-first UI (Nav, Home, About, Projects, Services, Contact)
- `styles.css` with simple neon accent

Next steps:
- Add routing (React Router) if you want separate routes per page
- Convert existing pages/content into components or fetch content from the repo
